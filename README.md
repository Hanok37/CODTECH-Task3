### Project Name: BlogSpot

**BlogSpot** is a simple, user-friendly web application that allows users to create and manage blog posts. This project aims to provide a seamless experience for users to write, edit, and view their blog entries. The web app features a minimalist design with a light/dark theme toggle for added customization. Below is a breakdown of the core features and functionality:

1. **Homepage and Navigation**: 
   - The page includes a **header** with the title "BlogSpot" and two interactive buttons:
     - **Theme Toggle** (ðŸŒž): Allows users to switch between light and dark modes to personalize their viewing experience.
     - **New Post**: Opens a form to create a new blog post.

2. **Create New Post**:
   - Users can easily create new posts through the form located under the "Create New Post" section.
   - The form includes:
     - **Title Input**: A text field where users enter the title of their post.
     - **Content Textarea**: A larger field for users to write the content of their blog post.
     - **Publish** and **Cancel** buttons:
       - **Publish** submits the form and adds the new post to the main page.
       - **Cancel** closes the form without saving the post.

3. **Dynamic Post Display**:
   - After a post is created, it is dynamically added to the **Posts Section** in the main content area. This section will display all user-generated blog posts as a list.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The app is built with responsive design principles, ensuring it looks good and functions well on a variety of devices, from desktop to mobile.

5. **Interactivity and State Management**:
   - JavaScript (via `index.js`) controls the appâ€™s interactivity, such as showing/hiding the new post form, handling theme toggles, and managing form submissions.
